## 1D Cavity
We follow Scully's layout in (in Quantum Optics, Ch. 1) and begin with a 1D cavity.

### Normal Mode Expansion
Following Scully, we take the electric field to be linearly polarized in the x-direction. We then expand the electric field in the **normal modes** of the cavity.

$$
E_x(z,t) = \sum_j A_j q_j(t)\sin(k_j z)
$$
- $v_j=j\pi c/L$ is the cavity eigenfrequency
- $V = L\,A$ is the volume ($A$ is the transverse area of the optical resonator)
- $A_j = (\frac{2 \nu^2_j m_j}{V \epsilon_0})^2$ 
- $m_j$ is a constant with dimension of mass. It is included so we can establish the analogy beween this system and a spring

Next we expand the non-vanishing component of the magnetic field $H_y$. 
$$
H_y = \sum_j A_j (\frac{\dot{q}_j \epsilon_0}{k_j})\cos(k_j z)
$$
### Classical Hamiltonian for a 1D cavity
The classical Hamiltonian for our 1D cavity is just an integration over the non vanishing field components ($E_x$ and $H_y$, which are only non-zero inside the volume $V$).
$$
\mathcal H = \frac{1}{2} \int_V d\tau (\epsilon_0 E_x^2 + \mu_0 H_y^2)
$$
When we substitute $E_x$ and $H_y$ with thier normal mode expansions, we can express the Hamiltonian of the radiation field as a sum of independent oscillator energies. 
$$\begin{align}
\mathcal H &= \frac{1}{2} \sum_j (m_j \nu_j^2 q_j^2 + m_j \dot q_j ^2)\\
&=\frac{1}{2}\sum_j \left( m_j \nu_j^2 q_j^2 + \frac{p_j^2}{m_j} \right)
\end{align}
$$
- $p_j = m_j \dot q_j$ is the canonical momentum of the $j$th mode.
- $q_j$ is the canonical position of the $j$th mode #TODO (needs verified)

## Atom-Field Interaction Hamiltonian

In many cases, we only need to concern outserlves with the dipole interaction between light and matter:

> $H = H_A + H_F -e\vec{r}\cdot\vec{E}$

Expanding this out term by term:

- $H_f = \sum_k \hbar \nu_k (a^\dagger a + 1/2)$ #field-hamiltonian
- $H_A = \sum_i E_i |i\rangle \langle i |$ #atom-hamiltonian
- $\vec E = \sum_{\vec k} \hat \epsilon_{\vec k}\,\mathcal{E}_{\vec k} (a_{\vec k} + a^\dagger_{\vec k})$ #descretized-field
- $e\vec r = \sum_{i j} |i \rangle \langle i | \vec r | j \rangle \langle j | = \sum_{i j} |\mathcal{D}_{i j} \sigma_{i j}$ 

Where $\mathcal{E}_{\vec k} = (\hbar \nu_k/2 \epsilon_0 V)^{1/2}$. When combining all of the above, we find that the dipole interaction Hamiltonian is given by:
$$
H = \sum_k \hbar \nu_k (a^\dagger a + 1/2) + \sum_i E_i |i\rangle \langle i| + \hbar \sum_{i j} \sum_{\vec k}g^{i j}_{\vec k} \sigma_{i j}(a_{\vec k} + a^\dagger_{\vec k}),
$$
where $$
g_{\vec k}^{i j} = -\frac{\mathcal D_{i j} \cdot \hat \epsilon_{\vec k} \mathcal{E}_{\vec k}}{\hbar}. 
$$
## Two Level Atom
We now look at the case of the 2 level atom. The Hamiltonian now takes the form:

$$
H = \sum_k \hbar \nu_k (a^\dagger a + 1/2) + \sum_i E_i |i\rangle \langle i| + \hbar \sum_{i j} \sum_{\vec k}g^{i j}_{\vec k} \sigma_{i j}(a_{\vec k} + a^\dagger_{\vec k}),
$$

## Approximations used on this page
- `rotating wave approximation`:   We ignore counter rotating terms. This amounts to ignoring solutions that break energy convseravtion.
- `dipole approximation`:  We consider the case where we can assume the spatial variation of the field across the emmitter is negligable. In otherwords,  $\vec{k} \cdot \vec{r} \ll 1$
