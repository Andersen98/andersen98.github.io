# Part 1: Benzene Excited State Calculation with PySCF

In this tutorial, we will use PySCF to calculate the excited states and the electric dipole transition matrix elements of benzene. 

# Geometry Optimization

To start things off, let's use PySCF to optimize the geometry of our benzene molecule. We store the initial geometry in `mol` and then we use the PySCF extension called _geometry_ to optimize our geometry.

```{code} python
from pyscf import gto, dft
#define initial geometry of benzene
mol = gto.M(atom = """
C   1.209     0.698   0.000
C   0.000     1.396   0.000

C  -1.209    -0.698   0.000
C  -0.000    -1.396   0.000

    """,  # in Angstrom
    basis='6-31g',
    symmetry=True)
mf = dft.RKS(mol)

mol_eq = optimize(mf)

    We first extend the au units defined in calca.

	au electric field = au force / au charge
	au frequency = 1/au time
	au cavity strength = au force/sqrt(au energy)



# Units

## Units Defined in Wang 2021
In Wang 2021, the **cavity strength** is defined as :

	cavity strength func(excitation frequency, E field mode) = sqrt(2/(au action * excitation frequency))
		* au charge * E field mode

### Example of cavity strength given E field and excitation frequency
So for example suppose:
	
	my E field mode = 1.5 au electric field in au electric field => 1.5 au electric field
	my excitation frequency = 2.4 eV / au action in au frequency => 0.0882 au frequency
	
The associated cavity strength would then be:

	cavity strength func(excitation frequency = my excitation frequency, E field mode = my E field mode) 
		in au cavity strength => 7.1429 au cavity strength
		
### Sanity check of cavity strength unit
Oddly enough, Wang 2021 defines the **unit cavity strength** as:
	
	wang cavity strength = sqrt( eV) / nm 
	
We can re-evaluate our definition of cavity strength in terms of energy and length units:

	au cavity strength alternate = (au energy/au length) / (sqrt(au energy))
		=> sqrt(au energy)/au length
		
We see that our alternate definition indeed evaluates to a rooted energy divided by a length! This means we can move on since all is working as expected.

### Cavity loss and electric dipole moment

Wang 2021 defines the **unit cavity loss** as:

	wang cavity loss = eV/au action
	
Finally, Wang 2021 defines the **unit electric dipole  moment** as:
	
	wang electric dipole moment = au charge * angstrom


## PySCF

The relevant units used in PySCF are:

	pyscf energy = eV
	
	pyscf electric dipole moment = au charge * nm


## QuTip 

In QuTip, we specify a Hamilonian, loss rates, and time steps. The units we use are not set in stone, but we must make sure that they are consistent with one another.




# Calculating Benzene in a Leaky Cavity


## Wang 2021

Wang 2021 specifies a cavity mode of interest with a cavity  :

	wang cavity strength params  = [ .001 , .002 , .008 ] * wang cavity strength
	
	wang cavity loss params = [.001, .004, .008 ] * wang cavity loss
	
We can compute coupling

### TDDFT Benzene Results

Using PySCF (in particular the TDDFT module) we find the excited states of Benzene as well as the relevant electric dipole transition moment:

	my excitation energy = 6.93 eV
	my electric dipole moment = 1.89 au charge * bohr
