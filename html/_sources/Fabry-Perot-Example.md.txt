# QNMs of 1D Fabry-Perot Resonators

We will try to gain insight into the properties of QNMs by investigating the case of a 1D Fabry-Perot resonator. As we go through the example, keep in mind that  will expect  the field in the resonator can be written as a sum over its different resonant modes. 


## Problem Setup
We are given a slab that:

- is of length $L$
- has a refractive index $n(\omega)$ [^1]
- is embedded in a hoogeneous medium of refractive index $n_1$

**Given this setup, we wish to find a general solution to the field.** 

## Eigenmodes are just plane waves bouncing back and forth

In the absence of an incident wave, the field at frequency $\omega = ck$ can be written as the superposition of two counter-propagating plane waves inside the cavity and two outgoing plane waves outside.

Formally speaking:


* reflectance $r$
* transmission $t$
-  $E(z)= \begin{cases} A \exp (iknz)\pm A \exp(-iknz), & \text{for $|z| < \frac{L}{2}$ }\\ B\exp(ikn_1 z), & \text{ for $z\geq \frac{L}{2}$ }\\ \pm B \exp(-ikn_1z) , & \text{for $z \leq -\frac{L}{2}$ \end{cases}$
* $B\exp(ik n_1 L/2) = t A \exp(iknL/2)$


### Resonance Condition and leakage imply complex frequency

The resonance condition  The resonance condition says that the field amplitude $A$ should be recovered after one round trip in the resonator. This implies that
 $$A = r^2 A \exp(2iknL).$$
 - Since the cavity loses energy via leakage, **we know $|r^2| < 1$** 
 - SInce the cavity loses energy via absorption, **we know $\text{Im} (n)> 0$**

Thus, the solutions for mode frequency must be complex numbers:
$$ \tilde{\omega}_m = c\tilde{k}_m = \Omega_m - i \Gamma_m /2.$$

Which verify:

$$1 - r^2\, (\tilde{\omega}_m) \exp(2i \frac{\tilde{\omega}_m}{c}\,n(\tilde{\omega}_m ) \,L ) = 0$$
Our takeaway from this is that:

> The imaginary part of the complex frequency *restores the stationary state* in the leaky cavity by *amplifying waves*.
