# Meetings

A place to take bullet points for weekly meetings.


## May 31st 2022

- MeepCon 2022 (should I sign up?)
- Made the `docs` for this project
- Re-visited the quasinormal mode expansion method
  - https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/lpor.201700113
- Found the "good code book"
  - TODO finish consolidating ALL project code
  - TODO write reasonable test cases for my adaptive code
- Met with Ben to discuss nano-optics progress
  - He showed me some new molecules that they may look at later
  - I talked to him about my research in quasinormal modes. 
  - We both agreed it would be helpful for me to make a notebook that goes over a calculation
    - Ben was actually pretty excited about the gold nano-cavity analysis. He said most codes only focus on micro cavities.
    - I think that I may be able to code something up in javascript. At this point, web apps can use the GPU to solve 2D maxwell's equations [see here](https://github.com/RobinKa/maxwell-simulation)

### Recap
- TODO next time figure out how to connect greens function stuff to coupling parameter in hamiltonian
- look at W. Yan, R. Faggiani, P. Lalanne, Phys.Rev.B2018, 97, 205422.
